          <h3>Cyndi Taylor</h3>
<p>
Once upon a time a five-year-old girl decided that she wanted to be an artist
when she grew up. As the years passed, little by little, with hard work, study,
practice, prayer and perseverance the dream became reality.
</p><p>
That little girl is Cyndi Taylor, and since that dream began in 1961, she has
become an award winning artist, painting professionally since 1981. She started teaching
painting in 1995 when she received her certification as a Bob Ross Landscape Instructor which,
combined with majors in art and communication at the college level, has given Cyndi excellent
teaching skills and a personal mastery of landscapes, still life, portraiture and wildlife. Her
commissioned portraits hang in private homes and galleries across the nation, and her
students travel from as far as Texas and Colorado to paint in her workshops.
</p><p>
Cyndi lives in the historic district of Hannibal, Missouri, and holds open studio sessions and
portrait classes at the Hannibal Arts Council, The Rooster’s Crow Art Center in Hannibal, the
Quincy Senior Center in Quincy, IL and Hobby Lobby’s in the tri-state area. She has been
traveling and teaching portraiture since 1998 and has received numerous awards for her
portraits, including several Best of Show awards. She is the recipient of the Paragon Artist
Award from the Hannibal Arts Council which is presented annually to an artist in any medium
and any art form who has made a special contribution to the community’s art environment.
</p><p>
Professional affiliations include the Hannibal Arts Council, the Riverland Artist Group, the
Quincy Art Council and the Quincy Art Guild. Her most recent award was the Best of Show,
Professional Division in the Originale Art Competition at the Hannibal Arts Council.
Michael Gaines, Executive Director of the Hannibal Arts Council & Missouri Association of
Community Arts Agencies quotes, “Cyndi Taylor is a great asset to the Hannibal arts
community. The Hannibal Arts Council appreciates and has utilized her creative talents for
workshops, exhibits and demonstrations. Her teaching style enables and encourages students
to discover the artist within them.” Cyndi’s students have received many awards for paintings
created under her supervision.
