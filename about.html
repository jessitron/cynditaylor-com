          <h3>Cyndi Taylor</h3>
          <p>
            I am a professional portrait artist with over 15 years of experience capturing the essence and personality of my subjects. My journey as an artist
            began in childhood, where I developed a fascination with the human face and its ability to convey emotion and tell stories.
          </p>

          <p>
            After formal training at the Art Institute of Chicago, I dedicated my career to portraiture, working with families, individuals, and pet owners to
            create lasting memories through art. My work has been featured in local galleries and private collections throughout the country.
          </p>

          <p>
            I work primarily in charcoal, graphite, pastel, and oil paint, choosing the medium that best suits each subject and commission. My style combines
            technical precision with an emotional sensitivity that brings portraits to life.
          </p>

          <h3>My Approach</h3>
          <p>
            I believe that a successful portrait captures not just a likeness, but the spirit and character of the subject. I take time to get to know my
            clients and their stories, which informs my artistic process and helps me create truly personal works of art.
          </p>

          <p>
            Each commission begins with a consultation where we discuss your vision, preferences, and the story you want to tell. I work from high-quality
            photographs (which I can take during our session) or from life sittings, depending on your preference and the nature of the portrait.
          </p>

          <h3>Studio</h3>
          <p>
            My studio is located in Hannibal, Missouri, where I work on commissions and teach occasional workshops for aspiring artists. Studio visits are
            available by appointment.
